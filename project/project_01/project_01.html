        <h1>One of seven wonders in the world.</h1>

        <p>
          The Taj Mahal is a magnificent white marbel mausoleum located in Agra,
          India. It was built by the Mughal Emperor Sha Jahan in memory of his
          beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Construction began in 1632 and was
          completed in 1653.
        </p>
        <p>
          Legend has it that Sha Jahan was grief-stricken after Mumtaz Mahal's
          death during childbirth, and he wanted to create a memorial that
          reflected his lover for her. The Taj Mahal is considered one of the
          most beautiful buildings in the world and is a symbol of eternal love.
        </p>
        <p>
          The architectural masterpiece was designed by the Persian architect
          Ustad Ahmad Lahori, blending Persian, Islamic, and Indian
          architectural styles. The main building is set in a large gerden with
          a reflecting pool, creating a stunning reflection of the Taj Mahal.
        </p>
        <p>
          The construction involved thousands of skilled artisans, laborers, and
          craftsmen, and a variety of precious materials were sourced from
          different parts of the world. The white marbel was brought from
          Makrana in Rajasthan, and the semi-precious stones for intricate inlay
          work came from various regions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Taj Mahal has stood the test of time and has become a UNESCO World
          Heritage Site. Millions of visitors from around the globe visit this
          iconic monument each year to witness its beauty and learn about the
          enduring love story that inspired its creation.
